especially those of the reign ol Edward the Con-
fessor, his narrative is in several instances much
more circumstantial than any to be found in the
existing manuscripts of that record, from which
ha also not unfreqnently deviates in dates,¹ par·
ticularly' in his relation of events during the
reigns of Edward the Elder and Edward the
Confessor. Whence it seems probable that he
had before him a copy of the chronicle varying
from any now extant, though bearing the nearest
resemblance to the Worcester manuscript.² On
events connected with Worcester, both Florence
and his continuator are naturally inclined to he
copiouS, as in the account of Bishop Wulfstan
(n. n. 1062), and ο1 his death (1095), no traces of
which are to be found in any manuscript of the
Saxon chronicle.

Florence's extracts from Asser’s Life of AEl-
fred-the larger portion ol which he has em-
hodied with his own peges—are particularly
valnable as serving in several instances to rectify
the printed text of that biographer.³

Appended to the joint chronicle of Marianus
and Florence are two continuationS, one to the
year 1141, which accompanies the printed text
in the preceding editions; the other to the year
1295, until now existing only in manuscript.
01 these, the first mentioned is the work of a
monk os Worcester named John, though hardly
. identical with another monk of the same name
