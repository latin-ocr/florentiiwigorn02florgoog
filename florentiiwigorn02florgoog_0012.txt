PREFACE.

Nnxr 'aiter the Ecclesiastical History of
Beda, and the Saxon Chronicle, the principa!
. source oi early English History is the chronicle
grafted on that of Marianus Scotus by Florence,
a monk ol Worcester.

The few particulars that have reached our

time of the Life of Marianus, are derived from
the notices contained'in ” the chronicle as com·
posed by Florence, viz. that he ,was a native

of Ireland, born in the year 10283 that in 1056

he forsook the land of his birth, and became a
monk in the Scottish cloister of St. Martin at
Cologne; that in 1059 he was ordained priest at '

. Wiirzburg, and then lived as a recluse at Fulda,
‘ which place he left in the year 1069 for Mente,

where, in the monastery of St. Alban the Martyr,
he died about the year 1086.¹

As the object here in view requires bnt a
slight notice of Marianus it will suffice to add,
that the work compiled by him, into which
Florence inserted his chronicle of English affairs,
is a general chronicle from the creation of the
world to his own times. On the supposition
that the Dionysian era of the birth of Christ
is fixed too late by twenty-two yearS, Marianus
added a double chronology to his' work, one

¹ His chronicle is continued abhot ol St. Disihod, in the dio-
to the year 120⁰, by Dodechin, cese ol Treves.
