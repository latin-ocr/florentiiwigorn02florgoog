In support of the foregoing view of the ease,
may he added, that, so far from exhibiting any
matter derived from Guy os Amicus-a writer
remarkahly diffuse aud circumstantial,-the

manuscript belonging to Corpus Christi Collega,
Cambridge. This continuation, from its com-

follows is a transcript, by the same hand, of the
chronicle os John de Taxster, a monk of Bury
St. Edmund’s, as sar as the year 1265 inclusive,
when the manuscripts of that chronicler termi-

monk of the same placa-probably the scribe
himselfi-as, among the events which he records,

space.

Though De Taxster, like other monastic
chroniclers, began his work with the Creation,
it is only from the year 1152, where it is taken. ⁴

of the Germanic tribes in Britain would have

been given, as an appendix to tho present
edition.
