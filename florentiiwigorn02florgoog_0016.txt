Now it is to bc observed, that Wulfstan died
in the year 1095, that is, twenty-three years
before the death os Florence himself, conse-
quently while the latter was husily employed
on the task ol incorporating his chronicle of
English affairs with the pages of Marianus. It
must also be horne in mind that Orderic was
not only a learned and well-informed man for
his time, hut that he was hy birth an English-
man, and one by no means indifferent to the
credit of his native country. Had it then hoen
the joint work of Marianus and Florcncc to
which, hy desire of Wulfstan, John appended
his own learned labours, is it at all prohable
that Orderic the Englishman would have desig-
nated it as the work os Marianus, omitting all
mention of the share taken init hy his fellow-
countryman, Florcncc of Worcestert More
probable seems the conclusion, that during wulf-
stan’s lifetime, and while Florence was engaged
on his work, the labours of John were bestowed
on the original chronicle of Marianus, and that
the manuscript containing those labours is no
longer known to exist. At all events, if any
part of any oi the extant copies is the work of
this John, it cannot he the Continuation, and
hardly any portion subsequent to 1095, tho year
of Wulfstan's death. In fine, can any part of
any copy ottho chronicle of Marianus Scotus
¹emhodying Florcncc os Worcester be pointed
out as answering the description given by
Orderic of the labours of the monk J ohnl
