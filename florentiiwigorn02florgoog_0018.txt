1. MS. Gorp. Ghr. Coll. Oxon. In large solio,
os the twellth century, written by the same hand
till towards the end. Prefixed to it (besides the
lists os prelates and royal genealogies given in
the present edition) are lists os kings of Franco,
dukes of Normandy, the seventy disciples, etc.
It ends abruptly at the year 1140, where it has
suffered mutilation.¹ This manuscript, though
occasionally less comprehensive than those to be
hereafter mentioned, may, nevertheless, be re-
garded as the purest and best extant. Iu the
margin are written, in another and, ol course,
later hand, many notices relating to the succes-
sions and deaths of bishops and abbots, which,
when not evidently copied from William ol
Malmesbury (De Gestis Pontificum), will be
found in the iorm of suot-notes to the present
edition. It is matter os regret, that, in the
insertion of these notices, more regard has not
been paid to dates. In a lew instances the
same entry is repeated nnder different dateS,
under one in the text and another in the margin.
These notices refer sor the most part to the sees
ol Hereford, Chester, and Lichfield. This
manuscript, which forms the basis ol the pre·
sent text, formerly belonged to the abhey os
Worcester.

11. MS. Lambeth 42. In large folio. Abean-
tilul book ol the end os the twelfth century.
Prelixed to it are some ol the lists of the
G. 0. C. Oxon. MS. It ends at the year 1131.9
This manuscript, which formerly belonged to

Abingdon, relating to which house it contains ,

several noticeS, agrees closely with the Oxford
one above-mentioned, and may be considered
